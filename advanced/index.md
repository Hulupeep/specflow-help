## Overview

This section covers advanced workflows for power users:

- **Manual Contract Creation** — Writing YAML contracts by hand
- **Custom Agent Development** — Creating your own specialized agents
- **CI/CD Integration** — Running Specflow in GitHub Actions
- **Schema Deep Dive** — Understanding the contract YAML format

**Note:** Most users should start with the [agent-first workflow](/getting-started/). Manual setup is 3-4x slower but gives more control.
