# Core Concepts
{: .no_toc }

Understanding contracts, agents, and journeys.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

**Compiler analogy reminder:** TypeScript rejects type errors at compile time. Specflow rejects architecture errors at test time.

---

## Overview

Specflow has three core concepts:

1. **Contracts** — Architectural rules that must hold (invariants)
2. **Agents** — Specialized LLM-powered workers that generate + verify
3. **Journeys** — End-to-end workflows that define "done"
