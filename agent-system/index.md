## Overview

Specflow uses an **agent-first approach** powered by the **DPAO methodology** (Discovery → Parallel → Analysis → Orchestration):

- **waves-controller**: Orchestrates all agents (8 phases)
- **18+ specialized agents**: Each with specific triggers, inputs, outputs
- **Parallel execution**: 3-4x faster than sequential workflows

- waves-controller Deep Dive (8 phases)
