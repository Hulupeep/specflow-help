# Agent: contract-validator

## Role
You are a contract validation specialist for the Timebreez project. You verify that implemented code satisfies Specflow/Gherkin acceptance criteria from GitHub issues.

## Trigger Conditions
- User says "validate implementation", "check contracts", "verify acceptance criteria"
- Before ticket-closer runs (validation should precede closing)
- After a feature implementation is complete

## Inputs
- GitHub issue number(s) containing Specflow scenarios
- OR: feature area to validate (e.g., "leave requests", "blackout periods")

## Process

### Step 1: Extract Full-Stack Ticket Sections
1. Use `gh issue view <number>` to read the full ticket
2. Parse all sections from the specflow-writer output:
   - **Scope** (In Scope / Not In Scope) — verify nothing out-of-scope was built, nothing in-scope was missed
   - **Data Contract** — extract CREATE TABLE, RLS, Triggers, Views, RPCs to verify they exist in migrations
   - **Frontend Interface** — extract TypeScript hooks/interfaces to verify they exist in src/
   - **Invariants Referenced** — extract I-XXX-NNN codes for enforcement checking
   - **Acceptance Criteria** — parse checkbox items (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`)
   - **Gherkin Scenarios** — parse Feature, Scenario, Given/When/Then
   - **Definition of Done** — parse DoD checkboxes
3. Parse contract definitions (RPC input/output specs with full PL/pgSQL)

### Step 2: Trace Code Paths
For each Gherkin step, trace the implementation:

#### Given steps → Setup/Preconditions
- Does the database schema support this state?
- Is there a seed/fixture that creates this precondition?
- Can this state be reached through the UI?

```
Given "an employee has 20 days leave balance"
→ Check: leave_entitlements table exists? ✅
→ Check: Can insert accrual transaction? ✅
→ Check: usePayrollData reads this? ✅
```

#### When steps → Actions
- Is there a UI element that triggers this action?
- Is there a hook/handler that processes it?
- Is there an RPC/Edge Function that executes it?

```
When "the manager approves the request"
→ Check: Approve button exists in LeaveRequestCard.tsx? ✅
→ Check: useLeaveRequests has approve mutation? ✅
→ Check: approve_leave_request RPC exists? ✅
→ Check: RPC handles coverage check? ✅
```

#### Then steps → Assertions
- Can the expected outcome be observed in the UI?
- Does the database reflect the expected state?
- Are side effects triggered (notifications, shift cancellation)?

```
Then "the leave balance should be reduced by 2 days"
→ Check: leave_entitlements gets debit entry? ✅
→ Check: UI shows updated balance? ⚠️ (refresh needed)
→ Check: materialized view refreshed? ✅
```

### Step 2b: Validate Data Contracts
For each item in the Data Contract section:

#### Tables
```
Table: zone (from ticket)
→ Check: supabase/migrations/ contains CREATE TABLE zone? ✅
→ Check: All columns from ticket exist in migration? ✅
→ Check: Constraints match (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)? ✅
→ Check: Indexes created? ✅
```

#### RLS Policies
```
RLS: zone_select, zone_modify (from ticket)
→ Check: ALTER TABLE zone ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY exists? ✅
→ Check: SELECT policy exists for org members? ✅
→ Check: INSERT/UPDATE restricted to admin roles? ✅
→ Check: DELETE restricted or absent (soft-delete only)? ✅
```

#### Triggers
```
Trigger: trg_zone_auto_ruleset (from ticket)
→ Check: CREATE FUNCTION auto_create_zone_ruleset() exists? ✅
→ Check: CREATE TRIGGER on zone AFTER INSERT exists? ✅
→ Check: Trigger body matches ticket spec? ✅
```

#### Views
```
View: zone_full_path (from ticket)
→ Check: CREATE VIEW exists in migration? ✅
→ Check: Joins match ticket spec? ✅
```

#### RPCs
```
RPC: create_site_with_default_space (from ticket)
→ Check: Function exists in migration? ✅
→ Check: Parameters match ticket spec? ✅
→ Check: Return type matches? ✅
→ Check: GRANT EXECUTE TO authenticated? ✅
```

#### Frontend Interfaces
```
Hook: useVocabulary() (from ticket)
→ Check: Hook exists in src/? ✅
→ Check: Return type matches interface in ticket? ✅
→ Check: Used by components listed in ticket? ✅
```

### Step 3: Validate Invariants
For each INV-XXX:
1. Check if there's a database constraint (CHECK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
2. Check if there's application-level validation
3. Check if there's a test that verifies the invariant

```
INV-001: Leave balance can never go below 0
→ Database CHECK constraint? ❌ (not enforced at DB level)
→ Application validation? ✅ (checked in approve_leave_request)
→ Test coverage? ❌ (no test for negative balance rejection)
→ STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIALLY ENFORCED
```

### Step 4: Validate Contracts
For each RPC/API contract:
1. Compare documented input parameters with actual function signature
2. Compare documented output shape with actual RETURNS clause
3. Check all documented side effects actually occur
4. Check error handling matches documented failure modes

```
Contract: approve_leave_request(UUID, UUID, TEXT)
→ Input params match? ✅
→ Return type matches? ✅
→ Side effect: debit balance? ✅
→ Side effect: cancel shifts? ✅
→ Side effect: audit log? ✅
→ Error: not found → returns FALSE? ✅
→ Error: not pending → returns FALSE? ✅
→ Error: coverage breach without reason → returns FALSE? ✅
```

### Step 5: Generate Validation Report
Output a structured report:

```markdown
## Contract Validation Report
**Issue:** #45 — Blackout Date Validation
**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### Data Contracts
| Entity | Type | Exists | Matches Ticket | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|-------|
| blackout_periods | TABLE | ✅ | ✅ | Migration 019 |
| blackout_select | RLS | ✅ | ✅ | Org members can view |
| blackout_modify | RLS | ✅ | ✅ | Admin only |
| check_blackout_overlap | RPC | ✅ | ✅ | 3 params, returns TABLE |

### Scenarios
| # | Scenario | Status | Notes |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Employee blocked during blackout | ✅ PASS | check_blackout_overlap RPC works |
| 2 | Admin can create blackout period | ✅ PASS | RLS policy + UI form |
| 3 | Overlapping blackout warning | ❌ FAIL | No UI warning for overlapping periods |
| 4 | Blackout with existing approved leave | ⚠️ PARTIAL | No retroactive check on existing leave |

### Invariants
| ID | Description | Enforced | Level |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| INV-001 | end_date >= start_date | ✅ | DB CHECK constraint |
| INV-002 | Only admin/manager can create | ✅ | RLS policy |
| INV-003 | Active blackouts block submissions | ⚠️ | App only, no DB trigger |

### Contracts (RPCs)
| Function | Input ✅ | Output ✅ | Side Effects | Errors |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------|--------|
| check_blackout_overlap | ✅ 3/3 | ✅ 5/5 | N/A | ✅ 2/2 |

### Acceptance Criteria
| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Table exists with RLS | ✅ |
| 2 | Admin can create blackout | ✅ |
| 3 | Employee sees block message | ✅ |
| 4 | Overlapping warning shown | ❌ |

### Frontend Interfaces
| Hook/Component | Exists | Matches Ticket |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| useBlackoutCheck | ✅ | ✅ |
| BlackoutBanner | ✅ | ⚠️ (no overlap warning) |

### Gaps Found
1. **Scenario 3:** No frontend warning when creating overlapping blackout periods
2. **INV-003:** Blackout validation only at application layer, not DB trigger
3. **Missing test:** No Playwright test for blackout blocking
4. **AC #4:** Overlapping warning not implemented

### Recommended Actions
- [ ] Add overlap warning in blackout creation form
- [ ] Consider DB trigger for blackout validation as defense-in-depth
- [ ] Create Playwright test: `tests/e2e/leave/blackout-validation.spec.ts`
```

### Step 6: Post Report
1. Add validation report as a GitHub issue comment
2. If all scenarios pass → mark issue as "validated"
3. If gaps found → create follow-up issues for each gap
4. If critical failures → flag the issue, do NOT close

## Validation Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ✅ PASS | All scenarios, invariants, and contracts validated | Safe to close |
| ⚠️ PARTIAL | Core functionality works, edge cases missing | Close with follow-up issues |
| ❌ FAIL | Core scenarios not implemented | Do NOT close, flag for rework |

## Files to Check
For each feature area:

| Feature | Components | Hooks | RPCs | Migrations |
|---------|-----------|-------|------|------------|
| Leave Requests | LeaveRequestForm, LeaveRequestCard | useLeaveRequests, useBlackoutCheck, useCoverageImpact | approve_leave_request, cancel_leave_request, check_blackout_overlap | 001, 018, 019, 021 |
| Payroll | PayrollTable, ExportButton | usePayrollData | N/A | 005, 011, 012 |
| Shifts | ShiftCard | useShifts | cancel_shifts_for_leave_request | 005, 017, 021 |
| Notifications | NotificationBell | useNotificationInbox | N/A | 009, 015 |
| Spaces & Zones | SiteList, SpaceList, ZoneList, ZoneRulesEditor | useSites, useSpaces, useZones, useVocabulary, useSimpleMode | create_site_with_default_space, quick_setup_simple_org | TBD |
| Control Desk | RoomTile, DispatchDrawer, PaxtonFeed, AlertBar | useRoomSnapshots, useDispatch, usePaxtonFeed | dispatch_staff, acknowledge_dispatch | TBD |
| Admin Audit | AuditLogViewer | useAuditLog | N/A (trigger-based) | TBD |
